ASSISTANT: Hi there! How can I help you today?
USER: I need you to draft an email for me.
ASSISTANT: What do you need the email to say?
USER: I need to invite someone to speak at a church event.
ASSISTANT: Do you have any specific details you need to include in the email?
USER: Just the usual stuff. The date, time, and location of the event, and a brief description of what the event is.
ASSISTANT: Okay, I can draft that up for you. Is there anything else you need to include?
USER: Nope, that's it. Thanks!
