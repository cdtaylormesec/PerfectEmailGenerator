ASSISTANT: Hi there! How can I help you today?
USER: I need you to draft an email for me.
ASSISTANT: What do you need the email to say?
USER: I need to update my friends on the progress of our group project.
ASSISTANT: Do you want to give me more details?
USER: Sure. We're working on a project for school and I need to update my friends on our progress.
ASSISTANT: Do you want to give me a little more information?
USER: Well, we're supposed to be working on the project together, but I've been doing most of the work. I just want to update them on where we're at and what still needs to be done.
ASSISTANT: Is there anything else you want to say?
USER: No, that's it.
