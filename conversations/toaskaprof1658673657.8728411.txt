Hi there,

I'm reaching out to you because I'm hoping to get your help with something. I'm struggling in one of my classes and I was hoping I could talk to you about it. I know you're really busy, so I'll just take a few minutes of your time. I would really appreciate any help you can give me. Thank you so much!
