Wut up next door! We just got a new naber moving in and I'm not to happy about it. I don't want no stinkin naber! Now we gotsta put up with the noise an commotion. When I wants peace an quiet I should be able to get it. So just be aware that I'll be keepin an eye on you. If you make too much noise I'll be comin over to tell you to pipe down. You betta be careful or you'll have me to deal with! Naberhoods are supposed to be peacful places to live. Not places full of loud people making a racket. So just be warned, I'll be keeping an eye on you!
