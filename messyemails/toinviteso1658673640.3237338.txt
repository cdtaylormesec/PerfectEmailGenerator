Hi there, I'm inviting you to my family reunion which is happening soon! I hope you can make it, it would mean a lot to me. The reunion is going to be at my house on Saturday the 25th of September at 1pm. I live at 123 Mockingbird Lane, Hope, Arkansas. The reunion is going to be potluck style, so please bring a dish to share! I hope to see you soon! messy person
