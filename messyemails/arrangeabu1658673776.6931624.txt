Hey there, I was wondering if you could do me a huge favor and help me out with something. I'm trying to arrange a business lunch at work, and I was wondering if you could help me out. I'm not sure who to invite, and I was hoping you could give me some ideas. I'm thinking maybe we could go to that new restaurant downtown, but I'm not sure if that's a good idea. I'm also not sure if I can afford it, so I was hoping you could help me out with that too. Anyway, if you could help me out, I would really appreciate it. Thanks!
