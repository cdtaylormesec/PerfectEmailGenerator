Heyyyyyy sis, I'm sorry for being such a screw up. I know I really hurt you when I ruined your graduation party. I was just so jealous that you were moving on and I was stuck in the same old place. I know it's no excuse, but I was really struggling and I took it out on you. I know I can be a really negative person and I promise to try and be better. I know I've said that before, but this time I really mean it. I don't want to lose my relationship with you. You're the only family I have left. I hope you can forgive me. Love, Your screw up of a sister
