I cant stand working here any more. Ive had it w/ the long hours, the crappy pay, and the impossible demands. Management is always on our backs, breathing down our necks, and were never given a break. This place is a total nightmare. I hate it here. And to top it off, they just announced that were going to have to start working Saturdays. I cant take it anymore. Ive had it w/ this place. Im quitting.
