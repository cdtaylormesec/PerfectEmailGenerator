Wrong house. Again. I can't even believe it. This is the third time this has happened this month. I'm starting to think that the mail carrier is doing this on purpose. I mean, how hard is it to deliver a package to the right house? All they have to do is look at the address. But no, they keep delivering it to the wrong house. Ugh. I'm so sick of this. I'm going to have to call the post office again and talk to that carrier. I don't even want to think about what they're going to say. I swear, if they don't get this right, I'm going to lose it.
