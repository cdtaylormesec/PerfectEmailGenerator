To whomever it may concern, I am writing to campus security to express my dissatisfaction with their lack of response to an incident that occurred last night. I was walking home from the library when I was accosted by a man who demanded my money. When I told him I didn't have any, he got angry and pushed me to the ground. I managed to get away and ran to the nearest security office, but no one was there. I knocking and yelling for help for several minutes before giving up and walking home. I am extremely angry that campus security did not respond to my call for help. This is unacceptable and I demand that something be done about it. Sincerely, [Your Name]
