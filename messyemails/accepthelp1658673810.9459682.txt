Hey, Sucks that you're struggling at work. I get it, work can be hard. But you know what? Suck it up and deal with it. You're not the only one who has to deal with difficult situations. Stop being such a whiny baby and accept help when it's offered to you. It's not that big of a deal. Just do it and move on. And stop moping around the office. It's really getting on my nerves. Cheers, Guy who's sick of your crap
