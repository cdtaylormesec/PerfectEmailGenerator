- Subject: A message of hope
- Hi all,
- I hope this message finds you well. I thought I would share a message of hope from the Bible with you all.
- "And we know that in all things God works for the good of those who love him, who have been called according to his purpose." - Romans 8:28
- I hope this brings you some peace and comfort in these difficult times.
- With love,
- The chaplain
