You've been dating your partner for a little over a year and you've decided that you're ready to take the next step in your relationship. You've decided to get married, but you want to tell your family in person so you don't want to announce it on social media just yet. You sit down at your computer to write an email to your parents and siblings to let them know that you're getting married. You tell them how happy you are and how much you love your partner. You ask them to come to your house so you can tell them in person. You end the email with a promise to keep them updated on your wedding plans.
