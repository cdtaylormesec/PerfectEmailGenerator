You're sitting at your desk, finalizing a few loose ends before you head out for lunch, when you see an email pop up in your inbox from your boss. She's thanking you for your quick response to her latest project request - and you can't help but feel a surge of pride as you read her words. You quickly type up a reply, letting her know that you're happy to help out however you can, and hit send. As you finish your lunch and head back to your desk, you can't help but feel grateful for the supportive work environment you're lucky to be a part of.
