I am writing to request help from the church for a mission trip. Our group is planning to travel to Guatemala to help build homes for families in need. We are raising money to cover the cost of materials, but we need help with travel expenses. If you could make a donation to our cause, it would be greatly appreciated. We are confident that we can make a difference on this trip, and your support would be instrumental in making it happen. Thank you for your consideration, [Your name]
