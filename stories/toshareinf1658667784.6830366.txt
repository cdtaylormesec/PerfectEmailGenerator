You are the youth pastor at a small church. One of the programs you offer is a Youth Bible Study that meets on Wednesday nights. You've recently decided to start a new program for the teenagers at your church and you want to let the parents know about it. You sit down at your computer and start composing an email to the parents of the teenagers in your church. You explain what the new program is and why you think it will be beneficial for their teens. You finish up by telling them how excited you are for the new program and ask them to encourage their teens to participate.
