You're sitting at your computer, minding your own business, when you get an email from a sender you don't recognize. The subject line reads "Hey neighbor!" and you open it, thinking it must be from someone who lives nearby. But as you read, you realize it's a scam. The person claims to have seen you around the neighborhood and says they have a package for you that they'd be happy to drop off. But all they need is your address and a few other personal details. You quickly close the email and report it as spam. But you can't help but wonder how many other people have fallen for this scam.
