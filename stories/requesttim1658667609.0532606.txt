You're at your desk, eagerly working away on a project when your boss comes over and asks to speak with you in private. They tell you that they've been noticing you've been putting in a lot of extra hours lately, and they appreciate it. However, they also think you could use a break. They suggest taking a few days off and recommend that you send an email to your team leader requesting the time off. You thank your boss and agree to do so. You sit down at your computer and compose an email to your team leader, requesting three days off. You explain that you've been working hard and could use a break. You finish the email and hit send, feeling confident that your request will be approved.
