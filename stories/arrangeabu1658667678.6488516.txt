You are working on a new business project with a colleague and you need to arrange a business lunch to discuss the next steps. You decide to write an email to your colleague to suggest a few different dates and times for the lunch. In the email, you explain why a business lunch is necessary and why you think it would be a good idea to meet in person. You also suggest a few different restaurant options near the office.
