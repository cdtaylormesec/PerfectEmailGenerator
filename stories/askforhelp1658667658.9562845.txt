It's 8:00 a.m. and I'm already behind on my project. I've been working on it for weeks, and I'm just not making any progress. I need to write an email to my boss asking for help. I'm not sure what to say, so I just start typing. Hi boss, I'm sorry to bother you, but I'm having some trouble with my project. I've been working on it for weeks, and I'm just not making any progress. I was wondering if you could help me with it. Thanks, Me I hit send and sit back, feeling relieved. I hope my boss will be able to help me with this project; I'm just not sure what to do at this point.
