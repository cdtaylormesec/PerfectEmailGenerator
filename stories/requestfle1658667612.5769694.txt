You are a working mom who needs to request flexible hours from your boss in order to accommodate your children's schedules. You have been a model employee for years, and you are confident that your request will be well-received. You compose an email to your boss, explaining your situation and why you need to adjust your hours. You are polite and professional, and you express your willingness to work hard to make up for any lost time. You hit "send" and wait for a response.
