I need to write an email to my brother apologizing for what happened at our parents' house last weekend. It was really childish of me to storm off like that and I didn't mean to hurt his feelings. I know he was just trying to help by taking my side, but I was feeling really overwhelmed and frustrated at the time. I hope he can forgive me and we can move past this.
