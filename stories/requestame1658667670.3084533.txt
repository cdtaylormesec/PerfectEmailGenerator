I need to write an email to my boss requesting a meeting. I want to discuss a potential issue I've been having at work. Recently, I've been feeling like my workload has been excessive and I'm starting to feel overwhelmed. I'd like to sit down with my boss and discuss how I'm feeling and see if there's anything that can be done to lighten my load a bit.
