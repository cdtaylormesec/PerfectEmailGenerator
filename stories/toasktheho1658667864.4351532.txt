I'm having some trouble with my housing situation and I need to email the housing office for help. I've been living in my apartment for a few months now, and I recently found out that the lease I signed was for a year, not six months like I thought. I can't afford to stay here for another six months, so I need to find a way to get out of my lease. I'm not sure what my options are, so I'm emailing the housing office to ask for help.
