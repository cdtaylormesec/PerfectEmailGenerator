It's a beautiful day and you're out for a walk with your dog. Suddenly, your dog takes off after a squirrel and before you can catch him, he's out of sight. You search for him for a while, but he's nowhere to be found. You're starting to worry so you decide to go home and see if he's returned. He hasn't, so you decide to send an email to your neighbor to see if they've seen him.
