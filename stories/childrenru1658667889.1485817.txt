It was a hot summer day and the kids were out of school. They were running around the neighborhood, playing in the sprinklers and riding their bikes. One of the kids, a little girl, ran into another person's yard. The homeowner saw her and called out to her. The little girl ran away. The homeowner was upset and decided to email the girl's parents. She explained what happened and said she didn't want the kids playing in her yard. She asked them to keep an eye on their daughter and make sure she doesn't trespassing in other people's yards.
