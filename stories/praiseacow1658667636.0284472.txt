You are the head of customer service for a large online retailer. One of your employees, Sarah, has been consistently going above and beyond to help customers with whatever they need. Her positive attitude and willingness to help has really made a difference in the department. You decide to write her a quick email praising her for her great work. "Hi Sarah, I just wanted to take a quick minute to tell you how much I appreciate your great work in the customer service department. You have a really positive attitude and are always willing to help out, no matter what the problem is. This has made a big difference in the department and I'm really grateful. Keep up the great work!"
