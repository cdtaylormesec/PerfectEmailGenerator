One person, we'll call her Sarah, has to write an email to another person, we'll call him James. Sarah is on a mission trip to a foreign country and she wants to update James and the other members of her church back home on what she's doing. She's been having a great time, but she's also seen a lot of poverty and suffering. She wants to share her experiences with James so that he can better understand what's going on in the world.
