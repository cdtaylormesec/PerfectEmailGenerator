I need to write an email to my boss asking for some information about a project we're working on. I'm not sure what the exact details are, but I need to know more in order to do my job properly. I've been working on this project for a few weeks now, and I'm starting to get a bit bogged down. I'm not sure what the next steps are, or what exactly my boss wants me to do. I need some more information in order to move forward. I'll shoot her an email and see if she can give me some more details. I'm hoping she'll be able to help me out so that I can get back on track with this project.
