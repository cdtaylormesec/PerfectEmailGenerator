You sit down at your computer, ready to write an update email to your family. You've been meaning to do this for a while, but life has been so busy! You want to let them know what's been going on in your life, and fill them in on all the latest news. You start typing, letting them know about your new job, your recent move, and all the other exciting things that have been happening in your life. You tell them about your plans for the future, and how you're doing overall. You finish up the email, feeling good about finally catching your family up on all that's been going on with you.
