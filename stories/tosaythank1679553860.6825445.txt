You have just finished dinner with your extended family. It was a lovely evening catching up with everyone and enjoying a home-cooked meal. As you begin to say your goodbyes, your Aunt pulls you aside and hands you an envelope. She tells you that it is a graduation gift and she is so proud of you. You thank her graciously and promise to open it when you get home. Once you are home, you open the envelope to find a handwritten note and a check inside. The note is from your Aunt, expressing her pride and well-wishes on your graduation. You are overwhelmed with gratitude and decide to write her an email to thank her.
