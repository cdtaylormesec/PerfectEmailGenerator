You sit down at your computer, ready to write an email to your family updating them on your life. You think about all that has happened since you last saw them and all that you want to tell them. You find the perfect words to describe your experiences and share your stories. You pour your heart into the email, telling them everything that has been going on in your life. You hit send, feeling happy and relieved that you were able to update your family on your life.
