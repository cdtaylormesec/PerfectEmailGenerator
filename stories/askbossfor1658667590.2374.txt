You sit down at your desk, ready to start your work day. But first, you need to write an email to your boss asking for a raise. You take a deep breath and begin typing. You explain that you have been with the company for X years and have been an exemplary employee. You have taken on extra projects, gone above and beyond your duties, and been a team player. You deserved to be rewarded for your hard work, and a raise would show that your boss values you and your contributions to the company. You hit send, and then sit back and wait. You know it's not going to be easy to get a raise, but you feel confident that you have made a strong case for yourself. Now it's just a matter of waiting to see what your boss says.
