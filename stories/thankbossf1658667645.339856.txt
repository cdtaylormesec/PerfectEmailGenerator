I had just learned that I had been promoted to a management position at my company. This was a huge accomplishment for me and I wanted to make sure that I properly thanked my boss for her faith in me. I sat down at my computer and began crafting an email expressing my gratitude. I told her how much I appreciated the opportunity and how excited I was to take on this new challenge. I assured her that I would work hard to live up to her expectations. I hit send, feeling confident that I had conveyed my thanks in a professional and sincere way.
