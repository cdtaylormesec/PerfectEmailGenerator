I was just walking back to my dorm from the library when I heard someone running up behind me. I turned around and saw a man coming towards me, and he looked really angry. I started to run, but he caught up to me and grabbed my arm. He told me to give him my wallet, and I said no. Then he pulled out a knife, and I was really scared. I screamed for help, and he ran away. I was shaking and I didn't know what to do, so I went to the campus security office and told them what happened. They told me to write an email to the head of campus security, so that's what I'm doing now.
