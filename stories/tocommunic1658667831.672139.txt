I am a student at the local university and I am having difficulty with my financial aid. I have been trying to speak to someone in the financial aid office for weeks, but I can never seem to get through on the phone. I even went down to the office in person, but they were so busy that I couldn't get anyone to help me. So, I've decided to send an email. In the email, I explain my situation and ask for help. Hopefully, someone will get back to me soon so that I can sort out my financial aid issue.
