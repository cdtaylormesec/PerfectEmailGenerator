You are working at your desk when your boss comes over and asks if you can write an email to the head of the HR department asking for a copy of the company's Employee Handbook. Your boss says that he needs the Handbook for a meeting he is having with the board of directors later this week. You agree to write the email and set to work crafting a polite yet firm message. You explain in the email that your boss needs the Handbook for an upcoming meeting, and request that a copy be sent over as soon as possible. You hit 'send' and lean back in your chair, hoping that the HR department will be able to get the Handbook to your boss in time for his meeting.
