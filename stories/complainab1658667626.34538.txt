I was sitting at my desk, minding my own business, when I heard a loud argument erupting in the cubicle next to me. I could tell that it was between two coworkers, and it sounded like they were really going at it. I tried to ignore it and focus on my work, but it was impossible with all the noise. Finally, I couldn't take it anymore. I got up from my desk and marched over to the two coworkers who were arguing. I told them in no uncertain terms that they needed to take their argument outside or take it to HR. The two coworkers reluctantly agreed, and they both left the area. But the damage was already done. I was so angry and frustrated by their behavior that I decided to write an email to my boss, detailing the entire incident.
