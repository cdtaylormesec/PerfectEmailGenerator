You're at work and you get an email from your best friend. They're asking for a favor - they need you to send them some money as soon as possible. They explain that they've been in a bind lately and they really need your help. You reply to the email, telling them that you'll send the money right away. You also mention that you hope things are okay and that you're there if they need to talk. You hit send, then go to your online banking to transfer the funds.
