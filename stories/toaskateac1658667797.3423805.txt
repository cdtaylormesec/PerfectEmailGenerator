It's the night before a big test and you're stuck. You've been studying all night, but the material just isn't sinking in. You're starting to panic. You remember your teacher saying that she's always available to help outside of class. You decide to send her an email asking for help. You explain the situation and ask if she can meet with you for a few minutes before the test. You promise to be quick and to not take up too much of her time. You hit send and then start pacing around the room, waiting for a response. A few minutes later, you get an email back from your teacher. She says she's happy to help and to come by her office 10 minutes before the test. Relief washes over you and you start to feel better. With your teacher's help, you know you'll be able to ace the test.
