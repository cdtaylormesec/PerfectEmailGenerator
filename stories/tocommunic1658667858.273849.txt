You're a college student who lives in on-campus housing. Recently, your toilet has been overflowing every time you flush it. You've tried plunging it and using a snake, but nothing seems to be working. You don't want to bother your roommates with the problem, so you decide to email your housing office. In the email, you explain the problem and ask if someone can please come and fix it. You also mention that you're afraid the problem will only get worse if it's not fixed soon. You hit send, hoping that someone will be able to help you out.
