You've worked at your job for a little over two years now. It's been a great experience, but you feel it's time to move on. You've been feeling this way for a while, but you weren't sure what the next step would be. But now you've finally decided that you're going to resign. You know it won't be easy to break the news to your boss. But you also know that it's the right thing to do. You decide to write an email to your boss, giving them two weeks notice. You start by thanking them for the opportunity to work at the company. You explain that you've been feeling like it's time for a change, and that's why you've decided to resign. You finish by saying that you're grateful for everything you've learned, and you wish the company all the best in the future.
