I was just walking back to my dorm from the library when I heard someone running up behind me. I turned around and saw a man coming towards me, and he looked really angry. I started to run, but he caught up to me and grabbed my arm. He told me to give him my wallet, and I said no. Then he pulled out a knife, and I was really scared. I screamed for help, and he ran away. I was shaking and I didn't know what to do, so I went to the campus security office and told them what happened. They told me to write an email to the head of campus security, so that's what I'm doing now.

PERFECT EMAIL:

To the head of campus security, I was just walking back to my dorm from the library when I heard someone running up behind me. I turned around and saw a man coming towards me, and he looked really angry. I started to run, but he caught up to me and grabbed my arm. He told me to give him my wallet, and I said no. Then he pulled out a knife, and I was really scared. I screamed for help, and he ran away. I was shaking and I didn't know what to do, so I went to the campus security office and told them what happened. I'm still really shaken up from what happened, and I'm not sure if I feel safe on campus anymore. I would appreciate it if you could increase security in my dorm building and make sure that there are always security guards on patrol. I also think it would be a good idea to send out an email to the student body letting them know what happened and advising them to be vigilant. Thank you for your time.
