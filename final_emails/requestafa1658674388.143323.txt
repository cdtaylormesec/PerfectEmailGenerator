I need to write an email to my boss requesting a favor at work. I'm hoping to get a raise, and I know that asking for a favor will likely increase my chances. I'm not sure what to say, so I'll just be honest and explain my situation. I've been working at the company for two years now, and I feel like I've been putting in a lot of extra effort lately. I'm hoping to get a raise to reflect my hard work. I know that asking for a favor will likely increase my chances of getting a raise, so I'm hoping you can help me out. Thanks, [Your Name]
