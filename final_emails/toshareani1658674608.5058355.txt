You are at your desk, working on a new project for work. You're feeling a bit stressed and overwhelmed, when you remember a message from the Bible that you read recently. You decide to email it to your co-worker, in hopes that it will inspire them and help them get through the day.

PERFECT EMAIL:

Hey there! I was thinking about you and the Bible verse that says, "Do not be anxious about anything, but in every situation, by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, present your requests to God." I hope that this message finds you well and gives you the strength to get through the day. You're doing great things and I know that God is with you! Praying for you, (Your Name)
