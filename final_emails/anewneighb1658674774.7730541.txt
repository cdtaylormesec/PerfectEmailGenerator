Hi, neighbor! We just got a new neighbor moving in, and I wanted to introduce myself. I hope you don't mind me saying, I'm a bit concerned about the noise level. I'm the kind of person who likes peace and quiet, and I was wondering if you could be mindful of that when you're making noise. I'll be keeping an eye on the situation, and if it gets to be too much, I'll come over and introduce myself in person. Neighborhoods are supposed to be peacful places to live, and I hope we can all work together to make that happen. Thanks for reading!
