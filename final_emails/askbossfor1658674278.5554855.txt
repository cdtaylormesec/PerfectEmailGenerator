I need to write an email to my boss asking for a new project. I'm feeling bored with my current project and I think a new challenge would be good for me. I'm not sure what my boss will say, but I'm hoping she'll be open to the idea.

PERFECT EMAIL:

Hi boss, I wanted to talk to you about something that's been on my mind lately. I'm feeling a bit bored with my current project and I think a new challenge would be good for me. I'm not sure what you think, but I'm hoping you'll be open to the idea. Thanks for considering it. Sincerely, [Your name]
