PERFECT EMAIL:

Hey family! I hope this email finds you all well! I'm doing great here and have lots of news to share. First and foremost, I got a new job! I'm really excited about it and think it's going to be a great fit for me. I'm also planning on moving to a new place soon, which I'm really excited about. I know we haven't seen each other in a while, but I really hope we can get together soon. I miss you all and there's nothing I would love more than to catch up in person. Anyway, that's all for now. I just wanted to let you know what's been going on and share my news. I hope to hear from you soon! Love, [Your name]
