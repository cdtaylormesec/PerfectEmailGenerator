I need to write an email to my boss updating her on my progress on the project we've been working on. I've been putting in a lot of extra hours and I think it's paying off - the project is really starting to come together. I want to make sure she knows what I've been up to and how well it's going.

PERFECT EMAIL:

Hi boss, Just wanted to update you on my progress on the project we've been working on. I've been putting in a lot of extra hours and I think it's paying off - the project is really starting to come together. I want to make sure you know what I've been up to and how well it's going. Thanks, [Your name]
