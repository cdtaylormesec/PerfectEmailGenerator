Hello Everyone, I would like to get input on what type of food everyone would like for the upcoming lunch meeting. Once I have an idea of what everyone is interested in, I will choose a restaurant that is convenient for all attendees and make a reservation. I will then send a calendar invite with the restaurant name, address, and phone number. The day of the lunch, I will follow up with everyone to confirm they are still coming. Thank you, [Your Name]
