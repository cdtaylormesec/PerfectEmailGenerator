For a limited time, we're offering a free SuperSonic Scrubber to our customers. All you have to do is pay for shipping and handling. I hope you'll take advantage of this great offer and try out the SuperSonic Scrubber. I think you'll be amazed at how well it works. Thanks for your time, [Your name]
