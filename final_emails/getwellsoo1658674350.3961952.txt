You're out of the office sick today, but you've been keeping up with work via email. Around noon, you get a message from your boss saying that she's sorry to hear you're not feeling well, and she hopes you'll be back soon. She asks if there's anything she can do to help, and you remember that you were supposed to send her a report that's due tomorrow. You shoot her a quick reply, letting her know that you can have the report to her by end of day, and apologizing for not being able to do it in person.

PERFECT EMAIL:

Hi boss, I'm sorry to hear that I'm out sick today, but I'm doing my best to keep up with work via email. I appreciate your concern and I'm sorry for the inconvenience. I should be able to have the report to you by end of day. Thanks, [Your Name]
