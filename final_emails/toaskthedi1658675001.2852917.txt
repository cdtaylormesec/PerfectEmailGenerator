Hey, I was wondering if you could help me out. I'm not sure if you know this, but the dining hall is a total disaster. There's food all over the place, the tables are dirty, and the staff is completely incompetent. I'm not sure what's going on, but it's really starting to Affect my health. I've been trying to talk to someone about it, but no one seems to be listening. Can you please see what you can do? It would mean a lot. Thanks, [Your Name]
