You sit down at your desk, ready to start your work day. But first, you need to write an email to your boss asking for a raise. You take a deep breath and begin typing. You explain that you have been with the company for X years and have been an exemplary employee. You have taken on extra projects, gone above and beyond your duties, and been a team player. You deserved to be rewarded for your hard work, and a raise would show that your boss values you and your contributions to the company. You hit send, and then sit back and wait. You know it's not going to be easy to get a raise, but you feel confident that you have made a strong case for yourself. Now it's just a matter of waiting to see what your boss says.

PERFECT EMAIL:

Hi boss, I wanted to talk to you about something important - my salary. I have been with the company for X years and have always been an exemplary employee. I have taken on extra projects, gone above and beyond my duties, and been a team player. I believe that I have earned a raise and that it would show that you value my contributions to the company. I would be very grateful if you could consider my request. Thank you for your time.
