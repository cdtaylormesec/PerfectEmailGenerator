To Whom It May Concern, I am writing to complain about the condition of the sidewalk in front of my house. It is cracked and in need of repair. Additionally, it has not been shoveled and is covered in snow and ice. This is a hazard for pedestrians and is a blight on our neighborhood. I am demanding that the sidewalk be fixed and shoveled immediately. Sincerely, [Your Name]
