The student walks into the dining hall, tray in hand. It's been a long day of classes and the student is famished. They walk up to the salad bar and start piling their plate high with greens. As they reach for the ranch dressing, their tray tips and the entire contents come crashing down to the floor. The student is embarrassed and quickly gathers up their tray and leaves the dining hall. They know they should probably go back and apologize, but they don't want to face the workers after such a humiliating incident. Instead, the student decides to write an email to the dining hall staff. They apologize for the mess and ask if there is anything they can do to help clean it up. They express their sincere gratitude for the hard work the staff does to keep the dining hall running smoothly.

PERFECT EMAIL:

Dear dining hall staff, I am so sorry for the mess I made at the salad bar. I know you must have been working hard to keep the dining hall clean and I really appreciate it. Is there anything I can do to help clean up the mess? I would be more than happy to help out in any way I can. Again, I am really sorry for the inconvenience I caused. Thank you for all your hard work.
