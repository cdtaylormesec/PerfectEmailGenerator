Heyyyyy, Soooo I was wondering if you could do me a solid and maybe help me out with a teensy favor? I know we're not super close but I promise it'll be super duper easy peasy and won't take more than two seconds of your time! Basically, I need you to do me a HUGE favor and just act like we're friends for like five minutes. My mom is visiting and she's super duper conservative and if she found out I had a gay friend she would literally flip her lid. Sooooooo it would mean the WORLD to me if you could just act like we're friends for like five minutes when she's around. I know it's a lot to ask but it would honestly mean so much to me and I would be super duper grateful! Let me know if you can do it or not, either way is totally fine! Thanks so much, [Your Name]

Hi [Teacher's Name], I hope you're doing well. I was wondering if I could ask for a small favor from you. My mom is visiting soon and she's very conservative. If she found out that I had a gay friend, she would be very upset. It would mean a lot to me if you could act like we're friends when she's around. I know it's a lot to ask. If you can't do it, that's totally fine. Thank you either way. Best, [Your Name]
