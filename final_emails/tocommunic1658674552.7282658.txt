It's the middle of the semester and I'm starting to feel overwhelmed. I've been to my professor's office hours a few times, but I need more help than they can give me. I decide to email my academic advisor to set up a meeting. In the email, I explain my situation and how I'm feeling. I tell them that I've been to office hours, but I need more help. I ask if they can meet with me to go over my coursework and help me develop a plan to get back on track. I send the email and wait for a response. A few hours later, I get an email back from my advisor. They say that they can meet with me tomorrow at 10am in their office. I'm relieved that my advisor is able to meet with me so quickly. I know that with their help, I'll be able to get back on track and succeed in my classes.

PERFECT EMAIL:

Hi [Advisor], I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed and I could really use some help. I've been to your office hours a few times, but I need more assistance than you're able to give me during that time. Can we schedule a meeting so I can go over my coursework with you and develop a plan to get back on track? I'm available tomorrow at 10am. Thanks, [Your Name]
