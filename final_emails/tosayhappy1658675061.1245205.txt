Hey there bruther, Just wanted to drop a quick note to say happy birthday! You're another year older today, which means you're one step closer to being old and decrepit like the rest of us! Just kidding, I hope you have a great day and enjoy your birthday. Lots of love, Your favorite sister

PERFECT EMAIL:

I'm so grateful to have you in my life, and I cherish our relationship more than you could ever know. I hope this year brings you everything you've ever wished for. Lots of love, Your favorite sister
