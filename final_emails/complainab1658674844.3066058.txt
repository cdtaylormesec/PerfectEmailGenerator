Hey, I realy dont appreciate when Peter comes in late and then expects me to pick up his slack. Its not my job to do his work for him, and Ive told him that several times. Ive had it up to here with him and his lazy attitude. Sincerely, Frustrated coworker

PERFECT EMAIL:

Hey Peter, I know you've been coming in late a lot lately and I'm just wondering if there's anything going on that we can help you with? I know it's not easy trying to balance everything, and we just want to make sure you're okay. As for your work, I know you're capable of doing a great job, but sometimes it seems like you're not putting in the same effort as everyone else. I just wanted to check in and see if there's anything we can do to help you get back on track. We're all rooting for you! Sincerely, Your concerned coworker
