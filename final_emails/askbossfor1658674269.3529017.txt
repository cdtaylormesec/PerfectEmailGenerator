You're sitting at your desk, working on a project for your boss. You've been with the company for a few years now, and you feel like you're due for a raise. You know your boss is fairly generous with raises, so you decide to write an email asking for one. You start by explaining how much you love your job and how grateful you are to have been with the company for as long as you have. You talk about how you feel you've been doing great work and how you think you deserve a raise. You finish by asking politely for a raise, and you promise to continue doing great work if you receive one. You hit send, and then you wait. You know your boss is busy, so you give her a few days to respond. But after a week goes by, you still haven't heard anything. You start to worry that maybe your boss doesn't think you deserve a raise after all. You decide to go to your boss's office and talk to her in person. When you get there, you see that she's on the phone and she looks upset. She gets off the phone and asks you what you need. You tell her you just wanted to check in about your email asking for a raise. She tells you she's sorry, but she's been too busy to respond. She says she'll look over your email and get back to you soon. You walk back to your desk, feeling a little disappointed. But you know you did the right thing by asking for a raise, and you're hopeful that your boss will give you one soon.

PERFECT EMAIL:

Hi Boss, I hope you're doing well! I wanted to check in with you about my email asking for a raise. I know you're really busy, so I understand if you haven't had a chance to respond yet. I just wanted to make sure you received it and that you'll be able to look it over soon. I'm really hoping for a positive response, because I feel like I deserve a raise. I've been with the company for a while now and I think I've been doing great work. I'm grateful for the opportunity to work here, and I promise to continue doing great work if you give me a raise. Thanks for your time, and I'll check back soon.
