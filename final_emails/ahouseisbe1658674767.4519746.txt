Sale house being! Dear whoever is interested, I am selling my house and I am very mad about it. The house is a mess and it is very difficult to keep it clean. I am also very grumpy and I do not like to be bothered. I do not want to deal with any potential buyers who are not serious about buying my house. Sincerely, The owner
