Sherry had just moved to a new town and was looking for a church home. She had been visiting various churches on Sundays, but hadn't found one that really felt like "home" yet. However, she really liked the looks of First Baptist Church and decided to give it a try. After the service, she introduced herself to the pastor and told him how much she enjoyed the service. She also mentioned that she was new to town and was looking for a church home. The pastor was very friendly and invited her to come back next Sunday. Sherry was so happy to have found a church that she wanted to invite her new friends to come with her. So, she composed an email inviting them to attend First Baptist Church with her the following Sunday.

PERFECT EMAIL:

Hi friends, I'm so excited to have found a church home here in our new town! First Baptist Church was so welcoming and the service was really wonderful. I'm going back next Sunday and I would love for you to come with me. Let me know if you're interested and I'll pick you up. Looking forward to hearing from you, Sherry
