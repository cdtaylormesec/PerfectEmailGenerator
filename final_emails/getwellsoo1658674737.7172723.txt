Hi everyone, Just a friendly reminder from HR â€“ if you're feeling sick, please stay home and rest up. We don't want anyone spreading illness around the workplace, and we all know how tough it can be to power through when we're not feeling our best. Thanks for helping to keep our workplace healthy and productive!
