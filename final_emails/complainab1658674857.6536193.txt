I cant stand working here any more. Ive had it w/ the long hours, the crappy pay, and the impossible demands. Management is always on our backs, breathing down our necks, and were never given a break. This place is a total nightmare. I hate it here. And to top it off, they just announced that were going to have to start working Saturdays. I cant take it anymore. Ive had it w/ this place. Im quitting.

PERFECT EMAIL:

Hi [Management], I wanted to reach out and let you know that I’ve been feeling really overwhelmed at work lately. I’m really not enjoying my job and I feel like I’m constantly stressed out. I understand that there are demands that need to be met, but I feel like I’m never given a break. I’ve also been really unhappy with the hours and the pay. I know that you’re under a lot of pressure too, but I feel like I’m constantly being micromanaged. I know that you’re just trying to do your job, but it’s really starting to wear on me. I was really disappointed to hear that we’re going to have to start working Saturdays. I was really hoping to have that day off to spend with my family. I know that you understand how important that is to me. I’m really at the end of my rope here. I’ve been thinking about quitting, but I really don’t want to leave you in a bind. I know that you value my work and I don’t want to let you down. But I’m just not sure if I can keep going at this pace. Can we talk about this? I’d really appreciate it if we could find a way to improve my working situation. I love the company and I don’t want to leave, but I just can’t keep going like this. Thank you for your time.
