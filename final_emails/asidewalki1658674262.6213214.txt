It's a cold winter morning and you're walking to work. As you step onto the sidewalk, you notice that it's cracked and in need of repair. You remember that you promised your boss you would email him about the repairs that need to be made around the office, so you pull out your phone and draft a quick email. In the email, you describe the cracked sidewalk and how it needs to be fixed. You CC your boss on the email and hit send.

PERFECT EMAIL:

Hi boss, I was walking to work this morning and noticed that the sidewalk is cracked and in need of repair. I wanted to make sure to email you about it so that the repairs can be made as soon as possible. Thanks, [Your name]
