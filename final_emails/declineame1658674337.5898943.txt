You're sitting at your desk when you receive an invitation to a meeting from your colleague. You quickly scan the invite and see that it's scheduled for next week. You know that you're already going to be out of the office on that day, so you'll need to decline the meeting. You open up your email and type out a quick message to your colleague, letting them know that you can't make it to the meeting. You hit send, and then get back to work.

PERFECT EMAIL:

Hi [Colleague], I saw your invite for next week's meeting and unfortunately I won't be able to make it. I hope everything goes well. Best, [Your Name]
