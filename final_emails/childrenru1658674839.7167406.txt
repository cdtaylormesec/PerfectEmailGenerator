Hi there, I'm getting really frustrated with the kids who run through my back yard. It's like they think it's their personal playground or something. I've asked them nicely to stay out, but they just keep coming back. Can't you do something about this? It's really getting on my nerves. Thanks, The annoyed neighbor

Dear neighbor, I hope you are well. I am writing to let you know that I have been having some trouble with children running through my backyard. It is becoming disruptive and difficult to enjoy my yard with this going on. I would appreciate it if you could talk to the children and ask them to stay out of my yard. Thank you for your time and consideration.
