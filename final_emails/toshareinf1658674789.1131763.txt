Hi Church Family, We are excited to announce a new program at our church - the Blessing Box! This is a program where people can donate food and other items to be given to people in need. We know there are many people in our community who are facing tough times, and we hoped that this program would be a blessing to them. If you would like to donate, please bring your items to the church office. We will be accepting donations during office hours, Monday to Friday. Thank you for your support, and we hope that this program will be a blessing to everyone involved.
