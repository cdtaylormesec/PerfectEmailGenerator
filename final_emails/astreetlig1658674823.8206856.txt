The street light on my block is out and it's been out for days! I've called the city a bunch of times and they keep saying they'll send someone out to fix it but no one ever comes! It's so dark at night now and I'm sick of it. This is totally unacceptable. Somebody needs to do something about this!

PERFECT EMAIL:

Dear City Officials, I am writing to inform you that the street light on my block has been out for several days. I have called the city multiple times and have been told that someone will be sent out to fix it, but so far no one has come. The lack of street lighting is becoming a safety concern, and I would appreciate if someone could be sent out to fix the light as soon as possible. Thank you for your time.
