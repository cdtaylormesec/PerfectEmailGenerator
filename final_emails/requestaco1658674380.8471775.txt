It's Wednesday morning and you've just arrived at work. Your boss has asked you to write an email to another colleague, requesting a conference call. You're not sure why, but you comply. You sit down at your computer and begin to write the email. Your boss has asked you to write an email requesting a conference call with a colleague. You do as you're asked, and send the email off.

PERFECT EMAIL:

Hi [colleague name], I hope you're well! My boss has asked me to request a conference call with you. I'm not sure what it's regarding, but I'm sure she'll fill us in when we speak. Can you do a call at [time] today? Let me know, thanks!
