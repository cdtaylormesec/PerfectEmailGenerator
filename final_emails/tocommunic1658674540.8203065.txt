You are a student who needs to email a teacher about an assignment. You forgot to do the assignment and it is due tomorrow. You explain what happened and why you need more time.

PERFECT EMAIL:

Hi Teacher, I'm sorry for the inconvenience but I forgot to do the assignment and it is due tomorrow. I completely understand if you can't give me more time, but I wanted to explain what happened and ask for a chance to make it up. Thank you for your time, Student
