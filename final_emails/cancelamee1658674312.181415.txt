I need to write an email to my boss cancelling a meeting. I'm not feeling well and I don't think it would be productive for me to come in.

PERFECT EMAIL:

Hi Boss, I'm sorry for the short notice, but I won't be able to make it in for our meeting today. I'm not feeling well and I don't think it would be productive for me to come in. I'll be sure to update you on what we need to discuss as soon as I'm feeling better. Thanks, Your Name
