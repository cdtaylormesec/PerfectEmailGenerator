You're trying to enjoy a quiet night at home when you suddenly hear a loud party coming from your neighbor's house. You wait for a while, hoping they'll quiet down, but it only gets louder. You decide you need to say something, so you draft an email to your neighbor. In the email, you explain that you can hear the party and ask them to please keep it down. You don't want to be rude, but the noise is really bothering you and preventing you from enjoying your own home.

PERFECT EMAIL:

Hi neighbor, I hope you're having a great time at your party, but I'm afraid it's a bit too loud for me. I can hear it clearly from my house and it's preventing me from enjoying my own evening. I would appreciate it if you could please keep it down a bit. Thanks!
