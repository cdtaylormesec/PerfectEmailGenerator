One person has to write an email to another apologizing for a mistake. This person had accidentally sent an email to the wrong person, and it contained some sensitive information. They feel awful about the mistake and want to apologize as soon as possible.

PERFECT EMAIL:

Subject: I'm sorry for the mistake Hi [Name], I wanted to apologize for the mistake I made in sending you the email with the sensitive information. I'm really sorry for the inconvenience and any stress that I may have caused you. I'll be more careful in the future to make sure that this doesn't happen again. Sincerely, [Your Name]
