You are working on a group project with some friends and you need to update them on the progress you have made. You decide to write an email so that everyone can see what has been accomplished. In the email, you include a detailed update on the project, as well as your plans for the next steps. You end the email by asking your friends for their input on the project.

PERFECT EMAIL:

I have also created a draft of the outline for the project. Next, I plan on working on the actual writing of the paper. I would appreciate any input you might have on the project. Feel free to email me or leave a comment on the Google Doc. Thanks, Your Name
