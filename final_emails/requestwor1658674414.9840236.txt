I'm emailing my boss to request a work from home arrangement. I live in a remote area, and the winter weather is making it difficult to get to the office. I've been working hard and staying late, so I'm confident that I can continue to meet my deadlines from home. Plus, with the savings on my commute, I'll be able to put in a few extra hours each week. I think this arrangement would be beneficial for both of us.

PERFECT EMAIL:

Hi boss, I hope you're well. I'm emailing to request a work from home arrangement. The winter weather is making it difficult to get to the office, and I've been working hard and staying late to meet my deadlines. I'm confident that I can continue to work effectively from home, and with the savings on my commute, I'll be able to put in a few extra hours each week. I think this arrangement would be beneficial for both of us. Thanks, [Your name]
