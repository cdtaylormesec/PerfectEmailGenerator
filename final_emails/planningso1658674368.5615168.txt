You are planning a social outing with friends and need to write an email to another friend to plan it. You went to their house for a party once and it was a blast, so you were thinking maybe you could go to a bar or arcade or something. You remember they like beer and tequila, so you'll have to keep that in mind when choosing a place.

PERFECT EMAIL:

Hey, party animal! I'm planning a social outing with some friends and was wondering if you wanted to join us. I had a great time at your place last time and thought maybe we could go to a bar or arcade or something. I remember you like beer and tequila, so I'll keep that in mind when choosing a place. Hope to hear from you soon!
