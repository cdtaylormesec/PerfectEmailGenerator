You're at work and someone asks you to do something that will help them out. You don't really have the time, but you don't want to say no. So you say you'll do it and then realize you can't. Now you have to write an email declining their request.

PERFECT EMAIL:

Hi [person], I'm sorry to say that I won't be able to help you out with [thing]. I thought I would be able to, but it turns out I'm just too busy. I hope you understand. Best, [Your Name]
