You are at your computer, about to write an email to your grandparents. You know they are getting older, and you want to tell them how much you love them. You start typing out a message, telling them about your life and how much you appreciate them. You hit send, and feel good knowing you told them how you feel.

PERFECT EMAIL:

Hello Grandparents, I hope this email finds you well! I just wanted to reach out and tell you how much I love you. You have always been so supportive and loving, and I am so grateful for that. As I get older, I realize how important it is to have grandparents like you in my life. I hope you know how much I love you and appreciate all that you've done for me. Love, Your grandchild
