Hi boss, I hope you're doing well. I regret to inform you that I need to cancel our meeting today. I'm not feeling well and don't think it would be productive for either of us if I were to attend. I apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused. Let me know if you need anything from me. Take care, [Your Name]
