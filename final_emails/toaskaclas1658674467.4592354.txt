You're sitting in your college dorm room, trying to focus on your upcoming biology test. But no matter how hard you try, you can't seem to focus. You keep thinking about the email you need to write to your classmate. You know you should ask for help, but you're worried about how they'll react. After all, you're supposed to be the smart one in the class. But you're just not getting it. You take a deep breath and decide to just go for it. You type out a quick email, asking for help with the material. You hit send before you can change your mind. Now all you can do is wait for a response.

PERFECT EMAIL:

Hi (classmate), I'm struggling to understand the material for our upcoming biology test. I was wondering if you could help me out. I know you're really good at this stuff, and I could really use your help. Thanks, (Your name)
