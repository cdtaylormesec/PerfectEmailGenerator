Hey, I'm not happy with the dining hall. The food is terrible and the service is even worse. I've been trying to talk to someone about this but it seems like no one cares. Can someone please do something about this? It's really getting old. Thanks, Frustrated Student

Hello, I hope you are well. I am not entirely satisfied with the dining hall experience thus far. The food options and quality could be improved, and the service is not up to par. I would appreciate if somebody could address these concerns with the appropriate party. Thank you for your time.
