I needed to send a document to my coworker so that they could work on it and then send it back to me. I wrote a short email explaining what the document was and why they needed to work on it. I then attached the document to the email and sent it off.

PERFECT EMAIL:

Hi [ coworker ], I'm sending you this document so that you can work on it and then send it back to me. Thanks, [ your name ]
