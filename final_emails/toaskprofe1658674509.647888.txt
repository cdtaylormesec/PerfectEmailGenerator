One person has to write an email to another asking for a syllabus. The scenario is that the person is a student who is trying to plan out their schedule for the upcoming semester. They need to know what is going to be required of them for the class so that they can make sure they have time for everything.

PERFECT EMAIL:

Hi Professor, I was hoping I could get a copy of the syllabus for your class? I'm trying to plan out my schedule for next semester and I need to know what is going to be required of me. Thank you, [Your Name]
