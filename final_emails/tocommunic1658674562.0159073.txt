I need to write an email to the registrar's office in order to communicate about an important issue. I have been having some difficulties with my course schedule, and I need to speak to somebody about it as soon as possible. I have tried calling the office, but I have been unable to get through. Sending an email is my last resort.

I have tried calling the office, but I have been unable to get through. Sending an email is my last resort. Thank you for your time, [Your Name]
