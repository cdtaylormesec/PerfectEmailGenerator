You've just welcomed a beautiful baby girl into the world! You're feeling elated and want to share the news with your close friend, who lives far away. So you sit down at your computer to compose an email, telling them all about your new bundle of joy. You start by sharing the good news that you've given birth to a healthy baby girl. You tell them how overjoyed you are, and how perfect she is. You describe what she looks like, and share a few of her first milestones. You finish by expressing how much you can't wait for your friend to meet her. Hitting 'send', you sit back and smile, feeling grateful that you can share this special moment with your friend, even though they're not there in person.

PERFECT EMAIL:

Hi Friend, I'm so excited to share the news with you that I've welcomed a baby girl into the world! She's absolutely perfect and I'm overjoyed. She's got a full head of dark hair, the cutest little nose, and the most beautiful blue eyes. She's already grabbed my finger and cooed, and I just know she's going to be walking and talking in no time. I can't wait for you to meet her, and I'm so grateful that we can share this special moment even though you're not here in person. Love, Your friend
