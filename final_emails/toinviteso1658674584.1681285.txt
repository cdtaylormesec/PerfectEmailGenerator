One person has to write an email to another inviting them to a family reunion. They may not have seen each other in awhile so the email needs to be sent in order to keep in touch and update them on what's going on.

PERFECT EMAIL:

Hey, long time no talk! I hope you're doing well. I'm writing to invite you to our family reunion. It's been a few years since we've all been together, so it will be great to catch up. The reunion will be held on July 15th at the Smith family farm. I hope you can make it! Best, [Your Name]
