Hi all, I'm excited to let you know about a new program we'll be starting up at the church soon. The program is designed to get parishioners more involved in the life of the church, and it's a great opportunity to meet other parishioners and make new friends. I'll be sending out more information about the program in the coming weeks, but in the meantime, please feel free to get in touch if you have any questions. I'm really looking forward to seeing everyone at the program!
