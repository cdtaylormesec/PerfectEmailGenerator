I'm sitting at my desk, trying to focus on my work, but I can't seem to shake this feeling of dread. I know I need to write this email, but I don't know where to start. I'm not even sure if it's the right thing to do. But I can't keep putting it off. I have to at least try. I take a deep breath and start typing. I explain the situation as best I can, trying to keep my tone neutral and not sound like I'm begging. I know this person is always busy, but I really need their help. I finish the email and hit send, knowing there's a good chance I won't get a response. But at least I tried.
