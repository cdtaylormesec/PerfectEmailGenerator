PERFECT EMAIL:

Dear friends, I wanted to share a story with you of how Christ has changed my life. Before I came to Christ, I was lost and struggling. I didn't know how to live or what to believe in. But then I heard the gospel and it all clicked. I realized that Christ died for my sins and that He is the only way to know God. Since becoming a Christian, my life has completely changed. I am no longer struggling and lost, but have found hope and meaning in Christ. He has given me a new purpose in life and I am now living for Him. If you are struggling in your faith, I encourage you to seek Christ. He is the only one who can give you true peace and joy.
