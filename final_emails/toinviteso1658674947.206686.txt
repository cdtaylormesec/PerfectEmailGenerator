Dear church event coordinator, I am writing to request that you book a speaker for an upcoming event. The event is a conference on environmentalism, and we are looking for a speaker who can talk about the intersection of faith and environmentalism. If you have a speaker in mind who you think would be a good fit for this event, please let me know. I am happy to provide additional information about the event and what we are looking for in a speaker. Thank you for your time and consideration. Sincerely, Event planner
