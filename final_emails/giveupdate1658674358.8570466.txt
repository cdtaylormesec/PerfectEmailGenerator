Subject: Pulling Your Weight Hi [team member], I wanted to update you on the situation with the work project. As you know, we're under a lot of pressure to get this done on time and within budget. I'm sorry to say that you haven't been pulling your weight and it's impacting the rest of the team. I need you to shape up or you'll be replaced. I know you're capable of doing the work, so I hope you'll get back on track and help us meet our deadline. Thanks, [Your name]
