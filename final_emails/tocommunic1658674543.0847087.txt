You are a college student and you need to write an email to one of your classmates about an assignment. You were both in class together when the assignment was given, but you didn't get a chance to talk to him about it before he left. You want to make sure that you are both on the same page before you start working on the project.

PERFECT EMAIL:

Hey [Classmate], Just wanted to make sure we're on the same page with the assignment we got in class today. I'm thinking we should start by [OUTLINE OF SUGGESTED PLAN]. Let me know if that sounds good to you or if you have any other ideas. Looking forward to getting started on this with you! Best, [Your Name]
