Hi there, I wanted to check in with you about the assignment. I'm not sure if you're doing it the right way, and I'm hoping you can explain what you're doing. I'm also not happy with how you're doing the assignment. I'm not seeing it done the way I wanted, and it's frustrating me. I hope you can try to do it the way I want. Thanks, Angry Person
