PERFECT EMAIL:

Hello, I hope this email finds you well. I am emailing to ask for a favor. I am in need of a new car and I was wondering if you would be willing to help me out by loaning me yours for a couple of months. I promise to take good care of it and return it to you in the same condition it is in now. I would really appreciate your help. Thank you, [Your name]
