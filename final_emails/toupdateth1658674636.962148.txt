One person, we'll call her Sarah, has to write an email to another person, we'll call him James. Sarah is on a mission trip to a foreign country and she wants to update James and the other members of her church back home on what she's doing. She's been having a great time, but she's also seen a lot of poverty and suffering. She wants to share her experiences with James so that he can better understand what's going on in the world.

PERFECT EMAIL:

Hey James, I'm having an incredible time on my mission trip! I've gotten to see so many amazing things and meet amazing people. But I've also seen a lot of poverty and suffering. It's been really eye-opening and I wanted to share my experiences with you so that you can better understand what's going on in the world. I really miss you and everyone back home. I can't wait to share more stories with you when I get back. Love, Sarah
