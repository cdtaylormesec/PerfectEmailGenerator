PERFECT EMAIL:

Dear [Employer], I am writing to express my dissatisfaction with my current working conditions. Specifically, I have not been given enough space to work comfortably, there is too much noise in the office, and I do not have the necessary supplies to do my job properly. I have brought these issues to the attention of my immediate supervisor, but they have not been addressed. I am therefore requesting that you take action to remedy the situation as soon as possible. Thank you for your time and attention to this matter. Sincerely, [Your Name]
