It's been a while since you've seen or talked to your friend or family member, so you decide to write them an email catching up on things. You tell them about what's been going on in your life, how you're doing, and ask about how they're doing as well. You might even ask if they want to get together for coffee or lunch so you can catch up in person.

PERFECT EMAIL:

Hi [ Friend/Family Member ], It's been a little while since we talked, so I figured I'd drop you a line and catch up. How have you been? I've been good. [ Tell them what's been going on in your life ]. I'm really hoping we can catch up soon. I'll buy you lunch/coffee? Let me know when you're free. Hope to talk to you soon, [ Your Name ]
