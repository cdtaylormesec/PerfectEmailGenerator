It's the night before a big test and you're stuck. You've been studying all night, but the material just isn't sinking in. You're starting to panic. You remember your teacher saying that she's always available to help outside of class. You decide to send her an email asking for help. You explain the situation and ask if she can meet with you for a few minutes before the test. You promise to be quick and to not take up too much of her time. You hit send and then start pacing around the room, waiting for a response. A few minutes later, you get an email back from your teacher. She says she's happy to help and to come by her office 10 minutes before the test. Relief washes over you and you start to feel better. With your teacher's help, you know you'll be able to ace the test.

PERFECT EMAIL:

Hi Mrs. Jones, I'm sorry to bother you, but I'm feeling really stuck on the material for tomorrow's test. I've been studying all night, but nothing is sinking in. I'm starting to panic. I remember you saying that you're always available to help outside of class. I was hoping I could take you up on that offer. Is there any chance we could meet for a few minutes before the test? I promise to be quick and not take up too much of your time. Thank you so much for your help. I really appreciate it. Sincerely, Your Student
