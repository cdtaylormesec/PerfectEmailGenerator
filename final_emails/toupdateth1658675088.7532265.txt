Hey y'all, Just wanted to give a quick update on the mission trip. It's been going great so far! We've been able to help a lot of people and it's been a really rewarding experience. However, I'm starting to get a little frustrated. I'm not sure how much longer we can keep this up. We're running out of supplies and I'm not sure how much longer we can keep going. I'll keep you updated, [Your name]
