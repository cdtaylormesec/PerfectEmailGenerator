I am a student who needs to request a meeting with a professor. I am struggling in the class and would like to discuss my options with the professor. I am not sure if the professor will be available, but I am hopeful that they will be able to meet with me. I will send an email to the professor requesting a meeting and explaining my situation.

PERFECT EMAIL:

Hello Professor Smith, I am a student in your Intro to Psychology class and I am struggling a bit with the material. I was hoping I could schedule a meeting with you to discuss my options. I am not sure if you are available, but I am hopeful that we can find a time to meet. Thank you for your time and consideration. Sincerely, John Doe
